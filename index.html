            This is an interactive component that animates a poem fading out piece by piece. It was requested by Kayla
            Kamibayashi
            for her graduation thesis, where she intended to create a dissolving experience and allow users to
            rediscover the lost
            content.

            This widget is built with Vue.js and Animate.css.
